This repository hosts my Master of Science capstone project involving the creation of a document clustering application leveraging natural language processing and machine learning in Python.

The document clustering script is contained in the file titled "NASA_project_model_lda_kmeans_revised2". To run the this script, you will need Python 3.7 and above and an active network connection. 

Follow the instructions below:

1) Download the "NASA_project_model_lda_kmeans_revised2" script file to your desktop.

2) Ensure the following modules have been installed:

- NLTK
- BS4
- Pickle
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Lxml

3) From the IDE of your choise, open the "NASA_project_model_lda_kmeans_revised2" file and run the script. It should take a few minutes to complete.

The following resources were used for guidance in developing the script:

- "Adrian Soup Excel Revised" webscraping script
- Nick Becker's clustering application for US federal laws (https://github.com/beckernick/clustering_us_laws/blob/master/clustering_laws_tfidf_knn.ipynb)
- Tutorials Point tutorial on clustering (for silhouette analysis) (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/artificial_intelligence_with_python/artificial_intelligence_with_python_unsupervised_learning_clustering.htm)
